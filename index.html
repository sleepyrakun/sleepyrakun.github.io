        <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p>Hi! I'm Andrew Haitsch from Danbury, Connecticut and a graduate of Henry Abbott Technical High School. I graduated with a focus in Precision Manufacturing, with machining being an interest of mine. I have a few hobbies especially in music, playing games, and just socializing with people. A fun fact about me is that raccoons are my favorite animal!</p>
